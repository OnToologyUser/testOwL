<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
M3-lite taxonomy is designed for the EU H2020 FIESTA-IoT project. It is a lite version of M3 ontology. M3-lite contains taxonomy for various QuantityKinds (commonly known as physical and environmental phenomena), Unit of measurements, different types of sensor and different types of domain of interests. M3-lite has evolved to serve the purpose of several testbeds that want to be part of federation provided by FIESTA-IoT. Most relevant testbeds integrated using M3-lite are EU FP7's SmartSantander testbed, UniS's (UK) SmartICS testbed, Inria's (France) Soundcity/Ambiciti testbed, KETI's (South Korea) Mobius testbed and EGM's (France) 4G testbed. More information on the above testbeds  along with those that have joined at the FIESTA-IoT platform is available via http://fiesta-iot.eu/index.php/fiesta-testbeds/. Intially, this taxonomy was a light weight version of M3 ontology and since 2016 has found its own separate way. 

We further acknowledge, testbed provider such as SmartSantander, UniS, KETI, Inria, and other open call testbeds for their valuable comments. Please report any errors to rachit.agarwal@inria.fr.
